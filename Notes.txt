Python : list -> Heterogeneous data [1, 1.3, True, False]
1. One Dimensional
2. Two Dimensional - Matrix
3. Multi Dimensional
4. Jagged Array ***
The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy,
Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch.
This algorithm offers O(n log(n)) performance on all data sets,
and is typically faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations.
